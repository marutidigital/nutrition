      <p>Protein is essential for building and repairing muscles, producing enzymes, and supporting immune function. But the "right" amount varies significantly depending on your goals.</p>
      <h2>General Recommendations</h2>
      <p>The WHO recommends <strong>0.83g per kg of bodyweight</strong> for the average sedentary adult. However, for athletes and active individuals, research consistently shows that higher intakes are needed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Endurance athletes:</strong> 1.2–1.4g per kg</li>
        <li><strong>Strength/power athletes:</strong> 1.6–2.2g per kg</li>
        <li><strong>Those trying to lose fat while preserving muscle:</strong> up to 2.4g per kg</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Best Protein Sources</h2>
      <p>Whey protein is the gold standard — it contains all essential amino acids and is rapidly absorbed post-workout. Our <a href="/products?category=Proteins">Protein collection</a> includes options for every goal and dietary preference, including vegan pea and rice protein blends.</p>
      <h2>When to Take Protein</h2>
      <p>Distribute protein evenly across 3–5 meals for optimal muscle protein synthesis. A post-workout shake within 2 hours of training is particularly effective for recovery.</p>
      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Aim for 1.6–2.0g per kg of bodyweight if you train regularly. Supplement with a quality whey or plant protein to hit your targets consistently.</p>

      <p>The pre-workout supplement market is flooded with flashy labels and proprietary blends. Here's what the science actually supports:</p>
      <h2>Caffeine (200–400mg)</h2>
      <p>The most well-researched ergogenic aid. Caffeine increases alertness, reduces perceived exertion, and can improve both strength and endurance performance by 5–10%.</p>
      <h2>Beta-Alanine (3.2–6.4g)</h2>
      <p>Reduces muscle acidity during high-intensity exercise. The tingling sensation (paresthesia) is harmless and indicates it's working.</p>
      <h2>Citrulline Malate (6–8g)</h2>
      <p>Boosts nitric oxide, increasing blood flow to muscles. Improves reps to failure and reduces post-workout soreness.</p>
      <h2>Creatine Monohydrate (3–5g)</h2>
      <p>One of the most proven supplements for strength and power output. Highly recommended to stack with your pre-workout.</p>
      <h2>What to Avoid</h2>
      <p>Proprietary blends that hide doses, excessive stimulants, and unproven ingredients like "muscle matrix complexes." Always check the label.</p>

      <p>Creatine monohydrate is one of the most studied, safest, and most effective supplements available. Here's your complete guide.</p>
      <h2>What Is Creatine?</h2>
      <p>Creatine is a naturally occurring compound found in muscle cells. It helps produce ATP (energy) during high-intensity, short-duration exercise like weightlifting and sprinting.</p>
      <h2>The Benefits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Increases strength and power output by ~10–15%</li>
        <li>Improves high-intensity exercise capacity</li>
        <li>Speeds up recovery between sets</li>
        <li>May improve brain function and reduce mental fatigue</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How to Take It</h2>
      <p><strong>Loading phase (optional):</strong> 20g/day split into 4 doses for 5–7 days to saturate muscles faster.<br/>
      <strong>Maintenance:</strong> 3–5g per day indefinitely. Timing doesn't matter much — just take it daily.</p>
      <h2>Which Form?</h2>
      <p>Creatine monohydrate is the most researched and cheapest. Creapure® (the German-certified form) is the purest available. Skip HCL, ethyl ester, and other expensive variants — they offer no proven advantage.</p>

      <p>No supplement replaces a calorie deficit, but certain compounds can meaningfully support fat loss when used alongside proper diet and training.</p>
      <h2>1. Caffeine</h2>
      <p>Increases metabolic rate by 3–11% and improves fat oxidation during exercise. The thermogenic effect is well-documented.</p>
      <h2>2. Green Tea Extract (EGCG)</h2>
      <p>Synergizes with caffeine to increase fat burning. Most effective for abdominal fat reduction over 12+ weeks.</p>
      <h2>3. Protein Supplements</h2>
      <p>High protein intake preserves muscle during a deficit and increases satiety. Whey protein is particularly effective at reducing hunger hormones.</p>
      <h2>4. Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA)</h2>
      <p>Modest evidence for reducing body fat percentage over 6–12 months, particularly when combined with resistance training.</p>
      <h2>5. Glucomannan</h2>
      <p>A soluble fibre that expands in the stomach, significantly reducing appetite. Take 1g with a glass of water before each meal.</p>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> These are tools, not shortcuts. A consistent calorie deficit through diet is still the primary driver of fat loss.</p>

      <p>Building muscle efficiently comes down to three pillars: progressive training, adequate nutrition, and sufficient recovery.</p>
      <h2>Training Fundamentals</h2>
      <p>Focus on compound movements: squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press, and rows. Aim for <strong>3–4 sessions per week</strong>, progressively adding weight or reps each session.</p>
      <h2>Nutrition for Growth</h2>
      <p>Eat in a slight calorie surplus (200–400 calories above maintenance). Prioritize protein (1.6–2.2g/kg). Don't fear carbohydrates — they fuel your training.</p>
      <h2>The Role of Supplements</h2>
      <p>Beginners gain muscle rapidly without supplements. However, protein powder is convenient for hitting protein targets, and creatine provides a meaningful strength boost from day one.</p>
      <h2>Recovery</h2>
      <p>Muscle is built during rest, not during training. Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep. Avoid training the same muscle group two days in a row.</p>
      <h2>Realistic Expectations</h2>
      <p>Natural beginners can expect 0.5–1kg of lean muscle per month in the first year. Focus on consistency over 12+ months, not quick fixes.</p>

      <p>Intense training increases the demand for certain micronutrients. Deficiencies can impair performance, recovery, and immune function.</p>
      <h2>1. Vitamin D3</h2>
      <p>Crucial for bone health, testosterone production, and immune function. Most Europeans are deficient, especially in winter. Supplement 2000–4000 IU daily.</p>
      <h2>2. Magnesium</h2>
      <p>Involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions. Athletes lose magnesium through sweat. Supports sleep quality, muscle function, and stress recovery.</p>
      <h2>3. Zinc</h2>
      <p>Essential for testosterone production, immune health, and protein synthesis. Often depleted in endurance athletes.</p>
      <h2>4. Vitamin C</h2>
      <p>Reduces exercise-induced oxidative stress and supports immune function during heavy training periods.</p>
      <h2>5. Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)</h2>
      <p>Reduces inflammation, supports joint health, and may improve muscle protein synthesis. Aim for 2–4g of EPA+DHA daily.</p>
      <h2>6. Iron</h2>
      <p>Critical for oxygen transport. Female athletes and endurance athletes are particularly at risk for deficiency. Get blood levels tested annually.</p>

      <p>The post-workout window is when your muscles are most receptive to nutrients. Getting this right accelerates recovery and adaptation.</p>
      <h2>Protein First</h2>
      <p>Consume 25–40g of fast-digesting protein within 2 hours of training. Whey protein is ideal — it's rapidly absorbed and rich in leucine, the key trigger for muscle protein synthesis.</p>
      <h2>Carbohydrates for Glycogen</h2>
      <p>Replenish muscle glycogen with 0.5–1g of carbohydrate per kg of bodyweight. Good options: rice, oats, fruit, or a carbohydrate supplement.</p>
      <h2>Don't Fear Fats</h2>
      <p>While fats slow absorption slightly, they don't negate the benefits of post-workout nutrition. Eat a balanced meal within 1–2 hours.</p>
      <h2>Hydration</h2>
      <p>Rehydrate with 500ml–1L of water post-training. Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium) are important after long or intense sessions.</p>
      <h2>Sample Post-Workout Meal</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Whey protein shake (30g protein)</li>
        <li>Banana or 2 rice cakes</li>

      <p>Intermittent fasting (IF) has gained significant attention for weight management. But for athletes, the picture is more nuanced.</p>
      <h2>Common IF Protocols</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>16:8</strong> — 16 hours fasting, 8 hours eating window</li>
        <li><strong>5:2</strong> — 5 normal days, 2 days of very low calories</li>
        <li><strong>OMAD</strong> — One meal a day (not recommended for athletes)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Potential Benefits</h2>
      <p>IF can simplify calorie control, improve insulin sensitivity, and support fat loss without muscle loss when protein intake is adequate.</p>
      <h2>Drawbacks for Athletes</h2>
      <p>Training fasted can reduce performance in high-intensity exercise. It's harder to consume sufficient protein and carbohydrates in a compressed eating window. Recovery may be compromised.</p>
      <h2>The Verdict</h2>
      <p>IF can work for recreational athletes focused on fat loss. For those prioritizing performance and muscle gain, a conventional 3–5 meal approach is generally superior. Always ensure you hit your protein targets regardless of the eating pattern you choose.</p>

      <p>The supplement industry generates billions in revenue — much of it from products that don't work. Here's a no-nonsense beginner's guide to what actually matters.</p>
      <h2>The Foundation (Start Here)</h2>
      <p>Before any supplements, your diet, training, and sleep must be in order. Supplements supplement a good lifestyle — they don't replace it.</p>
      <h2>Tier 1: Evidence-Based Essentials</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Creatine monohydrate (3–5g/day)</strong> — Most studied supplement. Safe, effective, affordable.</li>
        <li><strong>Protein powder (as needed)</strong> — Convenient way to hit protein targets. Not magic, just food.</li>
        <li><strong>Vitamin D3 + K2 (2000–4000 IU/day)</strong> — Most people are deficient. Critical for bones, hormones, immunity.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Tier 2: Useful But Not Essential</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Omega-3 (fish oil) — Anti-inflammatory, joint health</li>
        <li>Magnesium — Sleep quality, muscle recovery</li>
        <li>Caffeine — Performance booster</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Skip These</h2>
      <p>BCAAs (redundant if protein is adequate), testosterone boosters, fat burners, "muscle matrix" blends, and anything claiming extreme results.</p>
      <h2>Order of Priority</h2>
      <p>1. Dial in your diet → 2. Train consistently → 3. Sleep 7–9h → 4. Add creatine → 5. Use protein powder if needed → 6. Add vitamins</p>
